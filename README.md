# 2D Ising Model Monte Carlo Simulation

Personal project to simulate the 2D Ising model (for magnetization) in Python using MCMC Methods (Metropolis Algorithm).

## Folder Structure

- `src/` – Python source code for the Ising model and simulation.
- `experiments/` – Python code for the experiments with different initial conditions.
- `plots/` – Plots & Diagrams of grid and observables. 

## Getting started

This project will use a small set of common scientific Python packages. A minimal `requirements.txt` is included.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```
