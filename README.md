# 2D Ising Model Monte Carlo Simulation

Personal project to simulate the 2D Ising model in Python using Monte Carlo methods
(e.g. the Metropolis algorithm).

## Status

Initial skeleton only. Simulation code and notebooks will be added later.

## Planned structure

- `src/` – Python source code for the Ising model and simulation
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for experiments and plots
- `figures/` – Saved figures generated by the notebooks

## Getting started

This project will use a Python virtual environment and a small set of common
scientific Python packages. For now, a minimal `requirements.txt` is included.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
